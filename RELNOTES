ircd-hybrid-6.3 Release Notes
---------------------------
$Id: RELNOTES,v 1.12 2001/12/30 07:50:30 db Exp $


There have been a number of changes done since 6.0 release.

Administrator level
--===============--
o IP I lines must have usernames as well. i.e.
  I:*@192.168.0.0/24.... or your IP I lines will mysteriously stop working.

o make install runs properly on cygwin.

o Optional IGNORE_BOGUS_TS code, must be enabled network wide to be
  effective.

o Freeform I: line spoofing is always enabled, SPOOF_FREEFORM is no
  longer needed.

o STATS_P_NOTICE was added, when this option is enabled, STATS_NOTICE
  can be disabled, preserving user privacy, while still allowing opers
  to see when they are needed.

o HIDE_SERVERS_IPS prevents IP's from being visible to anyone, including
  server operators.

o The server will not start if it is already running.

o The included mkpasswd program can generate MD5 hashes on systems that
  support it.  Issue "mkpasswd -m" to generate.

o SERVERHIDE is fully functional, without breaking clients.

o All features not approved for EFnet use are disabled by default.
  Please look in config.h for more details.

o vimotd and viklines are installed along with viconf.

o P: lines can now be removed if there are no clients on that port.

o IP I: lines can include a username.  Consult example.conf for more
  information.

o RESTART requires the server name, like DIE.

o NO_CREATE_ON_SPLIT will allow users to join existing channel but
  not create new ones.

Oper level
--======--

o Server splits are now shown in +x mode (previously, only introductions
  were shown).

o STATS Q, K, D are now formatted correctly.

o UNDLINE is available to opers.

o UNGLINE (local server only) is available to opers

o STATS q (little q only) will show juped channels (mode +j)

o STATS F is available to opers (show TS channel statistics)

o TKLINE expires are shown to opers

o Message targets have changed somewhat:
  Old $irc.server -> $$irc.server New
  Old #host.mask  -> $#host.mask  New
  #host.mask is still supported as a transition aid.

User level
--======--

o The multiple message restriction (PRIVMSG target1,#target2,...)
  has been removed; any number of targets are now permitted (like
  Hybrid 5)

Technical level
--===========--

o Hostname checks accept ':' now, to allow for remotely connected IPv6
  clients.

o TS5 is used by default now.

o The block allocator uses mmap() if it is found.

o Hybrid uses a modified adns based resolver instead of res.c.

o The stock system zlib is now used.

Other documentation
--===============--

Operating system dependencies have been removed, there is no longer any
special code for AIX, SEQUENT, DYNIX, HPUX, Solaris, or pyr. We have
made a large effort to remove as many portability issues as possible.
The code should compile and run on any modern UNIX operating system that
supports POSIX.1 and ANSI-C. We know the code builds cleanly on BSD,
Solaris, and Linux. If it fails to work for you, or works on another
platform not listed here, let us know. We won't make any guarantees
about changing much to support anything weird, but if including a
standard header clears up a problem we'll probably do that.  This code
is known to _not_ compile on AIX.

The code now uses the ANSI-C assert macro in many places, this means
that if an invariant isn't, the server will core on the spot hopefully.
Using the assert macro also tends to slow down the code a bit, if you
like living dangerously and are running the beta, use -DNDEBUG when you
build the server and it will turn off the asserts. Production servers
should always be compiled with -DNDEBUG for maximum efficiency. NOTE: If
you are running a server with the asserts turned on and it cores on you,
please send us a stack trace if you can.
  
Command lines are different for this version of hybrid, most of the old
flags for debugging and running ircd from a terminal are gone and a
couple new ones have been added. Valid command line options that require
compile time options are silently ignored. 

Command line options for this version:
-d filename - specify d:line file
-f filename - specify config file
-h hostname - specify server name
-k filename - specify k:line file
-l filename - specify log file
-n          - do not fork, run in foreground
-v          - print version and exit
-x          - set debug level, if compiled for debug logging

Minimal logging is enabled by default, for the alpha/beta release it is
set to L_DEBUG in config.h by default, this can be changed to other
levels if the log gets too noisy (it shouldn't). Look at the log level
constants in s_log.h for allowable values. A SET option is available
for setting the value in real time. If you define USE_SYSLOG in your
config ircd will log to both the ircd.log file and syslog.

Authentication and DNS lookups are handled a bit differently now,
clients are completely ignored until both auth and DNS have completed.
This is not significantly different than earlier behavior but you should
notice slightly faster client connects.

I line handling has changed.  Ident lookups are now always done for
connecting clients.   An @ in the I line no longer turns off the tilde
'~' adornment in the case of an unidented client. You must use the
'-' prefix in the I line to turn off the ~ prefix for an unidented client.
Clients which do not ident will be sent into the kline/iline matching code
with a leading ~ character.  i.e. to allow a client onto your server
without a ~, use an I line such as:
	I:NOMATCH::-*db@*some.host.on.the.net
This will match this user, and will remove the ~ as seen on the net.

KNOWN BUGS:
There is a possibility that ircd will core dump if you there are errors
in your conf file.

Send bug reports to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org.  If it cored, please
include a gdb backtrace and a copy of your config.h.


Notes
--=--

The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
instructions:
1.  Change to the directory where the core file is
2.  Run gdb on the binary and the core file.  With an unmodified Hybrid-6,
    an example command line is below (in the /usr/local/ircd directory)
    $ gdb ./ircd ircd.core
3.  At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt"
4.  Save the output of the backtrace command and send it to
    ircd-hybrid@the-project.org.
5.  Be sure to save the ircd binary and the core file in a safe place in
    case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace provides.
