/* behavior change - (Thomas Helvey <tomh@inxpress.net>)
 * removed escape handling, none of the masks used with this
 * function should contain an escape '\\' unless you are searching
 * for one, it is no longer possible to escape * and ?. 
 * Moved calls rollup to function body, since match isn't recursive
 * there isn't any reason to have it exposed to the file, this change
 * also has the added benefit of making match reentrant. :)
 * Added asserts, mask and name cannot be null.
 * Changed ma and na to unsigned to get rid of casting.
 *
 * NOTICE: match is now a boolean operation, not a lexical comparison
 * if a line matches a mask, true (1) is returned, otherwise false (0)
 * is returned.

/* collapse - behavior modification (Thomas Helvey <tomh@inxpress.net>)
 * Removed mask escapes, we don't escape wildcards or call match
 * on a mask. This change is somewhat subtle, the old version converted
 * \\*** to \\**, the new version blindly converts it to \\*.
 * Removed code that did a lot of work but achieved nothing, testing
 * showed that the code in test for '?' produced exactly the same results
 * as code that ignored '?'. The only thing you can do with a mask is to
 * remove adjacent '*' characters, attempting anything else breaks the re.
