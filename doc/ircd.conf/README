Files description of 
doc/ircd.conf/


I still remember setting up my first ircd-hybrid irc server and remember
the feeling when I opened the example.conf and was overwhelmed by all the
info there. Over the years I've had several versions of this file and when
Nick Parrin and I set up our test net for this release of ircd-hybrid-6 (6.4) 
I gave him my current setup files to make it go faster. He suggested I'd
make them available for the rest of the world so here we are.

I'll try to make this a brief introduction to the configuration files that
is used for an actual efnet server (altho these are heavily modded), but
any in depth info regarding parameters and settings will be found in
example.conf still. This file is not a tutorial, nor the ultimate correct
thing. It's just a help to get started.


Files:

ircd.conf      -   The main ircd.conf which through .include statements 
                   load the rest of the configuration file.
ilines.conf    -   This file controls the I-lines or access lines.
ispoof.conf    -   Spoofed i-lines
olines.conf    -   IrcOperator o-lines.
ports.conf     -   Listener-ports for the ircd to listen too
qlines.conf    -   Q-lines or quarantine lines (aka jupes)
servers.conf   -   Contains other servers and hubs.
xlines.conf    -   IRCNAME Geco's bans.
ylines.conf    -   Y-lines or connection block lines.


I hope that by including these files that someone might benefit from them.
Take care and enjoy ircd-hybrid-6.
