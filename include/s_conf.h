 * Revision 1.47  2001/07/04 12:02:42  jdc
 * The Monster Update(tm) for hybrid-6 and cryptlinks.
 *
 * NOTE:  This apparently should work with hybrid-7, but it has one minor
 * bug which I have yet to be able to figure out.  Other than that, the
 * actual authentication seems to be working fine; there's got to be a
 * missing line of code somewhere, or something not being initialised right;
 * something like that.  An example of this problem (pentarou.parodius.com
 * is hybrid-6 with this code):
 *
 * *** Connecting to 255.255.255.255[hybrid.best.net].9000
 * *** Notice -- Link with hybrid.best.net[unknown@255.255.255.255] established: (TS ZIP QS EX CHW ENC:CAST/128,CAST/128) link
 * *** Notice -- inflate() error(-3): unknown compression method
 * *** Notice -- hybrid.best.net was connected for 1 seconds.  0/1 sendK/recvK.
 * *** Notice -- Server hybrid.best.net split from pentarou.parodius.com
 *
 * It looks to me as if the connection is being terminated immediately after
 * zlib kicks in.  The other end of the link (hybrid.best.net) shows one
 * obvious error which should be the key to fixing this bug:
 *
 * *** Notice -- Unauthorized server connection attempt from pentarou.parodius.com: Invalid cipher
 *
 * Please note despite the zlib-style error, I ***STRONGLY*** doubt it has
 * anything to do with zlib.  Either way, I'm submitting this because it's a
 * _MUCH_ further along than before, and it actually does work except for the
 * one small bug.  :-)  I believe the bug might be in s_serv.c somewhere
 * (particularly with the "ENC:" stuff), but someone will have to go over all
 * of this alongside me to figure out where the real bug is.  Once it's
 * squashed, we're practically ready to go!
 *
 * - doc/cryptlink.txt
 *     * Updated with the latest protocol information (same as hybrid-7s).
 *
 * - doc/example.conf
 *     * Properly document how to use the new "," cipher pre-requisite in
 *       the passwd field.
 *
 * - include/client.h
 *     * Changed "ciphers" definition from char * to struct CipherDef *.
 *
 * - include/m_commands.h
 *     * Removed definitons for m_cryptauth and m_cryptserv.
 *     * Added definition for m_cryptlink.
 *
 * - include/msg.h
 *     * Removed references to MSG_CRYPTAUTH and MSG_CRYPTSERV.
 *     * Added reference to MSG_CRYPTLINK.
 *
 * - include/s_conf.h
 *     * Added to ConfItem: rsa_public_keyfile definition (filename of keyfile).
 *     * Added to ConfItem: struct CipherDef *cipher (pointer into Cipher[] for
 *                          the per-conf definition of a cipher).
 *
 * - include/s_crypt.h
 *     * Removed CRYPT_CIPHERNAMELENGTH.  Silly.
 *     * Changed definition of CipherDef structure.  Moved from a typedef to
 *       an actual struct.
 *     * Changed extern definition for Ciphers[] table to be struct.  Goes
 *       hand in hand with the above entry.
 *     * Changed return type for crypt_selectcipher().  Now returns a pointer
 *       to a CipherDef structure.
 *     * Added function crypt_parse_conf().
 *     * Cosmetical changes.
 *
 * - src/Makefile.in
 *     * Removal of src/cryptauth.c and src/cryptserv.c.
 *
 * - src/channel.c
 *     * --UNRELATED TO CRYPTLINKS--: Moved definition of register t2 to
 *       ensure it only got used when it needed (due to -Wunused).
 *
 * - src/m_capab.c
 *     * Removed "," delimited support across the wire for cipher autoneg.
 *     * Changed methodology alongside "ENC:" comprehension during CAPAB.
 *
 * - src/m_cryptauth.c
 *   src/m_cryptserv.c
 *     * Both removed.  NOTE: I DO HAVE THESE LAYING AROUND IN A BACKUP
 *                      SOURCE TREE!  For debugging the above bug, I figured
 *                      we might need them!
 *
 * - src/m_cryptlink.c
 *     * Added.
 *     * Very simple to understand too; the functions are all practically
 *       identical, so if you wrote this code, it should still make sense to
 *       you.
 *     * Like in -7, we now use a table for SERV and AUTH lookup.  Great for
 *       expansion.
 *
 * - src/s_bsd.c
 *     * Moved from "CRYPTSERV %s %s :%s" to "CRYPTLINK SERV ...".
 *     * Cosmetical changes.
 *
 * - src/s_conf.c
 *     * Initialised the new rsa_public_keyfile and cipher ConfItem entries.
 *       Both default to NULL (as they should).
 *     * Added MyFree() entry for rsa_public_keyfile.
 *     * Added support for crypt_parse_conf() call during processing of C/N
 *       line phase.
 *     * Added log()s for bad C/N-line entries.
 *     * Cosmetical changes and comments.
 *
 * - src/s_crypt.c
 *     * Moved cipher names from things like "3DES" to "3DES/128".  This way,
 *       code all over the place in other portions does not have to permutate
 *       the actual keysize and the string using ircsprintf().  This was silly
 *       in the first place, IMHO, since we already stored the keysize and the
 *       strings both.
 *     * crypt_selectcipher() re-written to go through the Ciphers[] table
 *       a lot more effectively; goes alongside with the above entry too.
 *     * Removed unnecessary free() of cptr->ciphers.  No need for this any
 *       longer, since we just point right into the Ciphers[] table now.
 *       Ain't this what pointers are for?  ;-)
 *     * crypt_initserver() MAJORLY rehauled.  Tons of log() calls and new
 *       error messages in the case there's a problem.  Re-written due to the
 *       change from "char *ciphers" to "struct CipherDef *cipher".
 *     * Changed errorhandling slightly, so that things would be more proper
 *       ("if ... == NULL" vs. "if (!...)" in some cases).
 *     * Added crypt_parse_conf().  This is the magic function which actually
 *       parses the passwd entries in the C/N lines themselves and appropriate
 *       splits up the fields, assigning them to rsa_public_keyfile and
 *       cipher for ConfItem entries respectively.  I'm kind-of proud of this,
 *       even though it may not look like much.  :-)  The reason is that we
 *       were previously doing all of the parsing in crypt_initserver() -- a
 *       silly idea!
 *     * Cosmetical changes.
 *
 * - src/s_serv.c
 *     * Moved away from printing all of the available ciphers we had during
 *       the "ENC:" phase to simply printing the name of the one supported in
 *       cptr.  This was a major bug anyways -- it printed ALL THE CIPHERS IN
 *       THE TABLE, regardless if we actually supported them or not.  Ugh.
 *     * No more "%s/%i,%s/%i" garbage (see first change entry above for
 *       s_crypt.c).
 *     * Cosmetical changes.
 *
 * - src/send.c
 *     * --UNRELATED TO CRYPTLINKS--: Renamed "index" variable to "lindex,"
 *       to keep from conflicting with system-wide function index() and
 *       global variables.
 *     * Cosmetical changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.46  2001/06/16 15:47:02  db
 * - ok fixed a "dropped c line" bug. the problem was, both the hostname
 *   and servername have to match in attach_cn_lines, thats because
 *   you could have two servers on the same ip with different server names

 * removal. This will ensure that if a client resolved we will always get
 * it's hostent. Currently we are saving the hostent for the life of the client,
 * but it can be released once the access checks are finished so the resolver
 * cache stays reasonably sized.

 *
 * Revision 1.3  1999/07/03 20:24:20  tomh
 * clean up class macros, includes
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1999/07/03 08:13:09  tomh
 * cleanup dependencies
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1999/06/23 00:28:37  tomh
 * added fileio module, changed file read/write code to use fileio, removed dgets, new header s_conf.h, new module files fileio.h fileio.c
